\begin{frame}{PS8, Ex. 7: Dissolving a partnership (Perfect Bayesian Equilibria)}
    Difficult. Exercise 4.10 in Gibbons (p. 250). Two partners must dissolve their partnership. Partner 1 currently owns share $s$ of the partnership, partner 2 owns share $1-s$. The partners agree to play the following game: partner 1 names a price, $p$, for the whole partnership, and partner 2 then chooses either to buy l's share for $ps$ or to sell his or her share to 1 for $p(1-s)$. Suppose it is common knowledge that the partners' valuations for owning the whole partnership are independently and uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, but that each partner's valuation is private information. What is the perfect Bayesian equilibrium?
