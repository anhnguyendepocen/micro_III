      Two companies want to acquire the drilling rights to a North Sea oil field. However, the companies are unsure about the value of these rights. They know the drilling rights have an identical value for both companies, and this value is either high $(H)$ or low $(L)$ with equal probability.\\\medskip
      The Danish government plans to hold an auction to sell off the rights, so each company sends a research team to the oil field to learn more about its value. The research team then sends a private report back to the company that sent it. Each report say the value is either $H$ or $L$, and is correct with probability $p$, where $\frac{1}{2} < p < 1$. The probability of a mistake is independent across the two reports.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Are the bidders’ values private or common?
        \item[(b)] Assume that company 1 receives a report of $H$. Given this report, what is the expected value of the oil field to this company?
        \item[(c)] Continue to assume that company 1 receives a report of $H$, and suppose that this company bids $b_H$ in the auction. Assume that company 2 will bid $b_L < b_H$ if its own report is $L$ and $b_H$ if it is $H$. Suppose that company 2 wins the auction if it places the higher bid and also in the case of a tie. Use Bayes’ to calculate the expected value of the oil field to company 1, conditional on it winning the auction. How does this value compare to your answer in (b)?

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(a)] Are the bidders’ values private or common?
    \end{itemize}
    Though the reports investigating the values are private, the bidders' actual values are \textit{\textbf{common}} since they are identical, i.e. $v_1=v_2=v$.
