\begin{frame}{PS11, Ex. 6: Spence’s education signaling model (PBE)}
    Consider the following version of Spence’s education signaling model, where a firm is hiring a worker. Workers is characterized by their type $\theta$, which measures their ability. There are two worker types: $\theta\in\{\theta_L,\theta_H\}$. Nature chooses the worker’s type, with $p_H=\mathbb{P}[\theta=\theta_H]$ and $p_H=\mathbb{P}[\theta=\theta_H]=1-p_H$.\\\smallskip
    The worker observes his own type, but the firm does not. The worker can choose his level of education: $e\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$. The cost to him of acquiring this education is $c_\theta(e)=e/\theta$. Education is observed by the firm, who then forms beliefs about the workers type: $\mu(\theta|e)$. We assume that the marginal productivity of a worker is equal to his ability and that the company is in competition such it pays the marginal productivity: $w(e)=\mathbb{E}[\theta|e]$. Thus, the payoff to a worker conditional on his type and education is $u_\theta(e)=w(e)-c_\theta(e)$. Suppose for this exercise that $\theta_H=3$ and $\theta_L=1$.\vspace{-4pt}

        \item $(e_H,e_H)$ is not viable, as $F$ would not hire unless the probability of type $\theta_L$ is $p_L=0$.
        \item \vspace{-2pt} No deviation, thus, we have a PBE:

        \item[3.i] Education is unproductive; it only serves as a signal of one's ability.
        \item[3.ii] \vspace{-4pt} Under competition, $F$ pays marginal productivity, thus, it is indifferent between $n$; $h|e_L,\theta_L$; and $h|e_H,\theta_H$. I.e. $F$ has no reason to run the risk of overpaying a $\theta_L$ that imitates $\theta_H$.
