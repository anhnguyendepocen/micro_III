  \textbf{Solution:} Consider the separating PBE where sellers of bad cars don't give warranty, but sellers of good cars do. Go through the signaling requirements:\\\smallskip
  SR3: The beliefs of the consumer $C$ that are consistent with this separating strategy are that it's a good car if the sellers gives warranty and a bad car if not, i.e. $\mu(Bad|W)=p=0$ and $\mu(Bad|NW)=q=1$. (1 point)\\\smallskip
  SR2R: Given these beliefs, the consumer buys a car with a warranty but does not buy a car without a warranty as:
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}[u_C(W,B)|p=0]=2&>0=\mathbb{E}[u_C(W,N)|p=0]\\
    \mathbb{E}[u_C(NW,N)|q=1]=0&>-1=\mathbb{E}[u_C(NW,B)|q=1]&&\text{(1 point)}
  \end{align*}
  SR2S: Sellers of good cars nor sellers of bad cars wants to deviate as:
  \begin{align*}
    
  \end{align*}
