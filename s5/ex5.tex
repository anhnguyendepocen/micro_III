    Consider the game below where player 1 chooses the matrix (A or B), player 2 chooses the row (C or D), and player 3 chooses the column (E or F). In each cell, the first number gives the payoff of Player 1, the second number the payoff of Player 2, and the third number the payoff of Player 3.

    \textbf{In the static game:} $(A,C,E)$ with outcome (5,2,2) cannot be a solution. Player 2 and 3 will not play $C$ and $E$ as they expect player 1 to play $B$ instead and get (6,0,1).\\\medskip
    \textbf{In the dynamic game:} Player 1 can expect at higher payoff on the left side of the tree than on the right side, thus, commits to $A$, allowing Player 2 and 3 to play $C$ and $E$.
