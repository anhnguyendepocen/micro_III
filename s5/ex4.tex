    Consider a game where two evil organizations, rather prosaically named A and B, are battling for world domination. The battle takes the form of a three-stage game. Organization A is on the verge of acquiring a new powerful weapon, the \textit{mutated seabass}. In stage 1 of the game, they decide whether to acquire the weapon or not. Their choice is observed by organization B. In stage 2, organization B decides whether to attack organization A. If an attack occurs, the game stops. If no attack occurs, it moves to stage 3, where organization A decides whether or not to attack organization B. The payoffs are as follows. If no-one attacks the other, the payoffs to both organizations are 0. If B attacks A, then the payoffs to both organizations are .1. The same if A attacks B, without having acquired the seabass weapon. If, on the other hand, A acquires the weapon, the payoffs from A attacking B are 2 to A and -2 to B.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(a)] Draw the game tree that corresponds to the game. What are the strategies of the players?
      \item[(b)] What is the backwards induction outcome?
      \item[(c)] What is the intuition for the outcome? What role do you think it plays that B observes if A acquires the weapon or not?

    \begin{itemize}\normalsize
      \item[\nth{3} stage:] Org. A will choose to attack if having acquired the weapon and not attack if not having acquired the weapon.
      \item[\nth{2} stage:] Org. B will choose to attack if Org. A has acquired the weapon and not attack if they have not acquired the weapon.
      \item[\nth{1} stage:] Org. A will choose to not acquire the weapon in order to signal peaceful intentions to Org. B, i.e. giving the payoffs $(0,0)$.

      \begin{itemize}\normalsize
        \item[\nth{3} stage:] Org. A does only benefit from attacking if having acquired the weapon.
        \item[\nth{2} stage:] Org. B will only choose to attack if Org. A has acquired the weapon.
        \item[\nth{1} stage:] Not acquiring the weapon is a credible signal that Org. A will not attack.

    I.e. what is the outcome if Organization A cannot send a signal in the \nth{1} stage?

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(c)] What role do you think it plays that B observes if A acquires the weapon or not? I.e. what is the outcome if Organization A cannot send a signal in the \nth{1} stage?
      \begin{itemize}\normalsize
        \item[\nth{3} stage:] [unchanged] Org. A will choose to attack if having acquired the weapon and not attack if not having acquired the weapon.
        \item[\nth{2} stage:] Knowing that Org. A will attack if having acquired the weapon, Org. B chooses to attack first, giving the payoffs $(-1,-1)$ regardless of stage one.
        \item[\nth{1} stage:] Org. A cannot affect the outcome, but acquires it in case Org. B deviates.

      \item[(c)] Fool-proof alternative solution method:
      \begin{itemize}\normalsize
        \item[\nth{3} stage:] [unchanged] Org. A will choose to attack if having acquired the weapon and not attack if not having acquired the weapon.
        \item[Reduce:] Substitute in Org A's best actions and outcomes from the \nth{3} stage to get the reduced form game which is a static game.
        \item[Bi-matrix:] Write up the normal form of the reduced game and highlight best responses:

    The strategy $(Not\ acquire, a, na')$ is weakly dominated by $(Acquire, a, na')$ and the unique Subgame Perfect NE is crystal clear:

      SPNE=\{S_A,S_B\}=\{(Acquire, a, na'),A\}
