    Consider the following game G:
    \begin{table}
      \begin{tabular}{cl|c|c|c|}
        & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Player 2}\\
        \parbox[t]{1mm}{\multirow{4}{*}{\rotatebox[origin=r]{90}{Player 1}}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Suppose that G is repeated infinitely many times, so that we have G(1, $\infty$). Define trigger strategies such that the outcome of all stages is (A,X). Find the smallest value of $\delta$ such that these strategies constitute a SPNE.

        %\item The following is how I personally would write my answer at the exam, it cannot be guaranteed that writing your answer in this way would yield full points.
        \item[(a)] Suppose that G is repeated infinitely many times, so that we have G(1, $\infty$). Define trigger strategies such that the outcome of all stages is (A,X). Find the smallest value of $\delta$ such that these strategies constitute a SPNE.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-6pt}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  Trigger strategies such that the outcome of all stages of the game is (A,X) are possible using respectively B,Y or C,Z as the threats. Since the threats B,Y will make the SPNE possible for the smallest $\delta$, I will use B,Y in the trigger strategies i define: \\
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Trigger strategy $P1$: In the \nth{1} turn, play A. In every subsequent turn, if outcome from every previous turn was (A,X), play A, otherwise play B.
    \item Trigger strategy $P2$: In the \nth{1} turn, play X. In every subsequent turn, if outcome from every previous turn was (A,X), play X, otherwise play Y.
    \end{enumerate}
    \vfill\null\columnbreak
    Player 2 has the highest incentive to deviate, so I only examine player 2's incentive to deviate. In order to find the lowest $\delta$ to secure cooperation, I set up the inequality for which the payoff for cooperation is higher than the payoff for deviating:
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{6}{1-\delta} &\geq 8 + \frac{2\delta}{1-\delta} \Leftrightarrow\\
        6 &\geq 8 - 8\delta + 2\delta \Leftrightarrow\\
        \delta &\geq \frac{1}{3}
    \end{align*}
    $\delta=\frac{1}{3}$ is the smallest value for which the strategies constitute a SPNE.

    Review the intuition from the ‘Doctor’ example in lecture 7 (slides 6-9), and then use Bayes’ rule to solve the following problem:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] \textit{A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. $85\%$ of the cabs in the city are Green and $15\%$ are Blue. A witness later recalls that the cab was Blue, and we know that this witness’ memory is reliable $80\%$ of the time. Given the statement from the witness, calculate the probability that the cab involved in the accident was actually Blue.}

    Information so far:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item P(B): The unconditional chance that a cab is green: $\frac{85}{100}$
        \item P(B): The unconditional chance that a cab is blue: $\frac{15}{100}$
        \item P(obs B\textbar B): The chance of remembering a blue cab, given it was blue: $\frac{80}{100}$
        \item P(obs B\textbar G): The chance of remembering a blue cab, given it was green: $\frac{20}{100}$
    \end{enumerate}
    P(obs B): The unconditional chance that the witness says the cab is blue, so the chance the witness would observe a blue cab and remember it as blue, plus the chance the witness would observe a green cab and remember it as blue:
    \begin{align*}
        P(obs\ B)=P(obs\ B|B)\cdot P(B)+P(obs\ B|G)\cdot P(G)=\frac{80}{100}\cdot\frac{15}{100}+\frac{20}{100}\cdot\frac{85}{100}=\frac{29}{100}
    \end{align*}
    We want to find the chance that the cab is blue, given that the witness says it's blue. Using Bayes' rule, this is the same as the odds that the cab will be blue and the witness says it's blue, divided by the unconditional chance the witness says it blue.
    \begin{align*}
        P(B|obs\ B)=\frac{P(obs\ B|B)\cdot P(B)}{P(obs\ B)}=\frac{\frac{80}{100}*\frac{15}{100}}{\frac{29}{100}}=0.414
