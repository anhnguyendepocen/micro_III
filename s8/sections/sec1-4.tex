    Consider the following game G:
    \begin{table}
      \begin{tabular}{cl|c|c|c|}
        & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Player 2}\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Suppose that G is repeated infinitely many times, so that we have G(1, $\infty$). Define trigger strategies such that the outcome of all stages is (A,X). Find the smallest value of $\delta$ such that these strategies constitute a SPNE.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The following is how I personally would write my answer at the exam, it cannot be guaranteed that writing your answer in this way would yield fill points.
        \item[(a)] Suppose that G is repeated infinitely many times, so that we have G(1, $\infty$). Define trigger strategies such that the outcome of all stages is (A,X). Find the smallest value of $\delta$ such that these strategies constitute a SPNE.
    \end{itemize}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  Trigger strategies such that the outcome of all stages of the game is (A,X) are possible using respectively B,Y or C,Z as the threats. Since the threats B,Y will make the SPNE possible for the smallest $\delta$, I will use B,Y in the trigger strategies i define: \\
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Trigger strategy $p1$: In the \nth{1} turn, play A. In every subsequent turn, if outcome from every previous turn was (A,X), play A, otherwise play B.
    \item Trigger strategy $p2$: In the \nth{1} turn, play X. In every subsequent turn, if outcome from every previous turn was (A,X), play X, otherwise play Y.
    \end{enumerate}
    \vfill\null\columnbreak
    Player 2 has the highest incentive to deviate, so I only examine player 2's incentive to deviate. In order to find the lowest $\delta$ to secure cooperation I set up the inequality for which the payoff for cooperation is higher than the payoff for deviating:
    \begin{align}
    \frac{6}{1-\delta} \geq 8 + \frac{2\delta}{1-\delta} \Rightarrow 6 & \geq 8 - 8\delta + 2\delta \Rightarrow & \delta \geq \frac{1}{3}
    \end{align}
    $\delta=\frac{1}{3}$ is the smallest value for which the strategies constitute a SPNE.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Review the intuition from the ‘Doctor’ example in lecture 7, and then use Bayes’ rule to solve the following problem:
        \item A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. $85\%$ of the cabs in the city are Green and $15\%$ are Blue. A witness later recalls that the cab was Blue, and we know that this witness’ memory is reliable $80\%$ of the time.\textbar the statement from the witness, calculate the probability that the cab involved in the accident was actually Blue.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item[] We wanna find the chance that the car is blue, given that the witness says it's blue. This is the samee as the odds that the car will be blue and the witness says it's blue, divided by the uncontional chance the witness says it blue.
        \item P(B) The chance that the car is blue: $\frac{15}{100}$
        \item P(obs B\textbar B): The chance that the witness says the car is blue, given that it is blue: $\frac{80}{100}$
        \item P(obs B\textbar G): The chance that the witness says the car is blue, given that it is green: $\frac{20}{100}$
        \item P(obs B): The unconditional chance that the witness says the car is blue, so the amount of chance the witness would look at a blue car and say it's blue, plus the chance the witness would look at a green car and say it's blue: P(obs B\textbar B)*P(B)+P(obs B\textbar G)*P(G)= $\frac{80}{100}$*$\frac{15}{100}$+$\frac{20}{100}$*$\frac{85}{100}=\frac{29}{100}$
        \item P(B\textbar obs B):$\frac{P(Obs B | B)*P(B)}{P(obs B)}=\frac{\frac{80}{100}*\frac{15}{100}}{\frac{29}{100}}=0.414$
