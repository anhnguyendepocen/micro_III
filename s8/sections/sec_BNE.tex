      \end{enumerate}
      \item[(Bonus)] Generally: In a BNE, strategies must maximize expected utility given the strategy of the other player(s) and the probability of them being each type. I.e. no type of any player has an incentive to deviate as in equilibrium player $i$'s strategy is a best response to player $j$'s strategy given player $i$'s beliefs:
      \begin{align*}
        s_i^*(t_i)\equiv\max\limits_{s_i}\sum\limits_{j\neq i}\sum\limits_{t_{jk}\in T_j}\mathbb{P}_i[t_j=t_{jk}]\cdot u_i\left(s_i(t_i),s_j^*(t_j)\right)
      \end{align*}
