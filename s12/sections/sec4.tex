\section{PS12, Ex. 4: Three-type job-applicant cheap talk game}

\begin{frame}{PS12, Ex. 4: Three-type job-applicant cheap talk game}
    Consider the following job-applicant cheap talk game based on \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.10.3.103}{Farrell-Rabin (1996)}. Suppose that there are three types of potential applicants (high ability, medium ability, and low ability) and the firm can place the applicant in one of three possible positions (highly qualified, medium qualified, low qualified). The applicant is equally likely to be each of the three types (probability 1/3). Payoff are represented below, where for each cell, the left entry gives the payoff of the applicant, and the right entry gives the payoff of the firm, conditional on the firm’s action and the applicant’s type. Notice: this matrix does not show the normal form game! It merely gives you the payoffs for each type-job combination, but does not incorporate the cheap talk message.\\
    The game is as follows: first, the applicant’s type is realized: $t\in\{L,M,H\}$, where $t=L$ corresponds to low ability etc. The applicant observes his type and sends a cheap talk message $m\in\{L,M,H\}$. The firm observes the message and chooses a job for the applicant: $a\in\{L,M,H\}$, where $a=L$ corresponds to giving the applicant the low qualified job etc.\vspace{-14pt}

      \item[(b)] Show that a partial pooling PBE does exist, where $m(H)=H$ and $m(M)=m(L)=M$. What are the firm's beliefs? Solve for each case.
      \item[(c)] (If time permits) Does a fully pooling PBE exist, $m(H)=m(M)=m(L)=H$?

    Type $H$ and $M$ prefer their corresponding jobs and will send the corresponding message to let themselves be identified. However, type $L$ would like to get a type $M$ job. Since messaging has no cost, in a separating equilibrium he would have an incentive to deviate and use the message $M$.

    Since $u_\text{S}(a=L)<max[u_\text{S}(a=M),u_\text{S}(a=H)]$ for all types, no fully separating PBE can exist, as no type will send the message $L$ to indicate type $L$, thus, letting the firm place one in the low ability position.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(b)] Show that a partial pooling PBE does exist, where the high-ability applicant sends the message $m = H$, and the other two types send the message $m = M$.
      \item[Step 1:] On the equilibrium path, find R's beliefs when receiving the messages $m=H$, $m=M$ and the corresponding best responses for the receiver.
    \end{itemize}\vspace{-6pt}
    In a PBE, the receiver needs to have beliefs corresponding to what happens in the game. This yields the following beliefs and best responses on the equilibrium path:\vspace{-2pt}
    \begin{align*}
        \mu(t=H|m=H)=1,\
        \mu(t=M|m=M)=\mu(t=L|m=M)=\frac{1}{2}
    \end{align*}\vspace{-18pt}
    \begin{align*}
        a^*(m=H)=H,\ a^*(m=M)=M
    \end{align*}\vspace{-18pt}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[Step 2:] Off the equilibrium path, find beliefs for $m=L$ and the corresponding best responses for R, which will uphold the PBE, i.e. such that S will not deviate.
    \end{itemize}\vspace{-6pt}
    We covered in (a) that no sender wants to get $a=L$, so find the beliefs which allows for $a(m=L)=L$. Consider $\mu(t=L|m=L)=1$ where R believes that if someone is to deviate, it's a low type and the best response is $a(m=L)=L$.\vspace{-2pt}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[Step 3:] Write up this partially separating PBE:
    \end{itemize}\vspace{-10pt}
    \begin{align*}
      \{\underbrace{(H,M,M)}_{m(H),m(M),m(L)},\underbrace{(H,M,L)}_{a(H),a(M),a(L)},\underbrace{\mu(H|H)=1}_{\mu(t|m=H)},\underbrace{\mu(M|M)=\mu(L|M)=\frac{1}{2}}_{\mu(t|m=M)},\underbrace{\mu(L|L)=1}_{\mu(t|m=L)}\}

    No, both type $M$ and $L$ would want something other than $a=H$, thus, the receiver should believe that someone who deviates and sends the signal $m=M$ is type $M$ or $L$ (each with probability $\frac{1}{2}$), and therefore, offer $a(M)=M$ in response which would be a Pareto improvement.
