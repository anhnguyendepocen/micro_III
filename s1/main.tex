\begin{frame}{Relevance of game theory}
\begin{multicols}{2}
From the course description:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] This course furthers the \textit{\textbf{introduction of game theory}} and its applications in economic models.
  \item[2.] The student who successfully completes the course will learn the basics of game theory and will be \textit{\textbf{enabled to work further with advanced game theory}}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[3.] The student will also learn how economic problems involving strategic situations can be \textit{\textbf{modeled}} using game theory, as well as how these models are \textit{\textbf{solved}}.
  \item[4.] The course intention is that the student \textit{\textbf{becomes able to work with}} modern economic theory, for instance within the areas of industrial organization, macroeconomics, international economics, labor economics, public economics, political economics and financial economics.

  The Travelers' Dilemma:\\\smallskip
  “An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers. Both suitcases look identical and contain identical items. An airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains that the airline is liable for a maximum of \$100 per suitcase, and in order to determine an honest appraised value of the antiques the manager separates both travelers so they can’t confer, and asks them to write down the amount of their value no less than \$0 and no larger than \$100. He also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and reimburse both travelers that amount.
\vfill\null
\columnbreak
However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other, this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will receive that amount along with the following: \$1 extra will be paid to the traveler who wrote down the lower value and a \$1 fine imposed on the person who wrote down the higher amount.”
